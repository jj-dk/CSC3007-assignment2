CSC3007 Information Visualization (2022) - Assignment 2

The Problem

    Let's say you are interested in this question: What type of serious crime was the most common in SG in 2020?
    Details can be found in this dataset here.
    You can either pull from the API or read off the CSV file / create your own JSON as the dataset is pretty small.

The Problem 2

    How would you present the problem hypothesis in a simple chart?
    You are allowed to add interaction or annotation in any way to help present your story.

Requirements

    This visualization cannot be a static png / jpg image.
    It must be a generated chart from some code (D3 or otherwise) and then published from a web repository.
